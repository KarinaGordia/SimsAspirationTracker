# SimsAchievementsTracker

This is my first Flutter project, designed to help track my achievements in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4. Currently, the tracking functionality is only available for The Sims 3, with plans to expand to The Sims 4 in the future.

Future developments you plan to implement.
- Add tracking functionality for The Sims 4.
- Improve the UI.

Contributions are welcome!
